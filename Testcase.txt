Test cases: 

1. Null strings
I/P : " "        -->           O/P : " " 

2. Replace strings with the Soundex codes:
I/P :  Jackson → J250      
I/P :  Write → W623

3. Considering Vowels.
I/P : Harris → H620
I/P : Oscar → O260

4. Retains first character.
I/P : Oliver → O416
I/P : Eve → E100
I/P : Charles → C642

5. H & W ignored.
I/P : Wright → W623 //W is retained as it is the first letter and h is ignored.
I/P : Hatch → H320 //First H is retained and second H is ignored.

6. Vowels inbetween two same codes.
I/P : BAF --> B110 //Vowel in between 

7. Two same codes separated by no vowels.
I/P: BPF --> B100

8. Vowels together.
I/P: AOEUI --> No code.
